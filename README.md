# FEWD_Project
Photo carousel project for Code Louisville FEWD Tues. Sept. 2017

This is a simple Photo Carousel showing some of my favorite Interior Design photos.
Biggest issue was just getting the pictures to center in the screen, solved with CSS targeting the img inside the container directly. Left and Right arrows change both size and color when the mouse is moved over them. Carousel functionality achieved using a simple if/then counter indexed to the numerical filenames in the img folder. Enjoy!
